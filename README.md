# Hello Bloc!
*Welcome to my first tutorial on Github!*

## Some things I might be good at include:

* **Visual Design.**
	One of my goals is to really improve my design skills.

* **Prototyping.**
	I bought a new computer and new software before starting this course. I have Adobe, Sketch and InVision. I'm considering getting Principle.
	
* **I'd like to be good at coding.**
	I'm not sure how good I'll be, but I have some background coding emails and editing CSS.
	
Here's a link to my current site that I need to redo while I'm at Bloc:
